ZENITS-SOS
Highway SOS Finder is a Web3-enabled, decentralized application (dApp) designed to assist stranded highway drivers by seamlessly connecting them with nearby, verified mechanics. Leveraging blockchain technology, the platform ensures trust, transparency, and efficiency in roadside assistance.

When a vehicle breaks down, drivers often face uncertainty, panic, and delays. Our platform solves this by providing a mobile-optimized interface that displays real-time availability of mechanics, estimated arrival times, distance, and contact options â€” all secured on-chain.

Key Web3 features include:

Decentralized Identity (DID): Both drivers and mechanics verify their identities using blockchain credentials, building trust without centralized intermediaries.

Smart Contracts: Service requests and payments are handled through secure, transparent smart contracts, ensuring automatic payouts once the job is completed and verified.

Reputation System: Mechanics' ratings and service history are stored immutably on the blockchain, helping users make informed decisions based on decentralized feedback.

Emergency SOS Button: Prioritized assistance requests are logged on-chain to ensure tamper-proof response records and faster mechanic matching.

By integrating Web3 principles, Highway SOS Finder not only improves the customer experience but also decentralizes the assistance ecosystem, ensuring a more secure, transparent, and community-driven approach to roadside emergencies.
